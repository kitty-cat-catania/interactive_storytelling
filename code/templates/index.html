<h1>Human Migration Across the United States</h1>
<p><i>In this project: we tracked Human Migration across the United States.</i></p>
<p>In  1948-1985 we witnessed  a steady increase in total movers, after which there was a steady decline in movers. </p>
    <p>The most common reasons for moving are those related to housing.</p>
    <p>Most American movers stay within the same county.</p>

    <!--<p>The chart above graphs  why people . We combined reasons into four general categories over the past 20 years: 
        housing, family, job, and other. Housing included better neighborhoods, cheaper housing, 
        eviction, ownership, and upsizing. Family combines establishing household,
        changes in marital status, and other reasons related to family. 'Job' consists of moving for an easier commute, 
        new jobs, retirement, searching for a job, and other job-related reasons. Other includes moving for health reasons, 
        because of natural disasters, relationships (besides marriage), college, climate, and other. 
    </p>-->
    <p>Although moving for reasons related to housing is the most common reason for moving throughout the past two decades, 
        the four different reasons do begin to converge, but only slightly. There was a steep decline in moving for 'Other' 
        during the period between 2010 and 2014. One could extrapolate that this is likely at least mildly correlated with the aftermath of the Great 
        Recession of 2008, during which the housing market collapsed and many Americans struggled financially.

    <p>This line chart graphs total movers in America (domestic, movers from abroad, and Americans moving abroad) from 
        1948 until 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>Total movers peaks in 1985, then steadily declines. During recessionary periods, 
        there is a sharp decline in total movers. This is evidenced by the steep downward trends in 2001 and in 2008. Also noteworthy is the possible correlation 
        between the steep rise in total movers during the period of 1984-1995 and the economic expansion of those years. 
    </p>
    <p>The trend of decling total movers was surprising to us, as we hypothesized that the number of total movers
        would increase over time.
