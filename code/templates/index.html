<h1>Human Migration Across the United States</h1>
<p><i>In this project: we tracked Human Migration across the United States.</i></p>
<p>Lets set up the story here. Who moved where? Why did they do it? Were there movers that moved more or less? Set up some mystery.</p>
<p>We can really get into some dialog here. </p>

    <p>The chart above graphs the reasons why people moved over the past two decades. We combined reasons into four general categories: 
        housing, family, job, and other. Housing reasons included better neighborhoods, cheaper housing, 
        eviction, ownership, and upsizing. The 'Family' reason combines establishing own household,
        changes in marital status, and other reasons related to family. 'Job' consists of moving for an easier commute, 
        new jobs, retirement, searching for a job, and other job-related reasons. Other includes moving for health reasons, 
        because of natural disasters, relationships (besides marriage), college, climate, and other. 
    </p>
    <p>Although moving for reasons related to housing is the most common reason for moving throughout the past two decades, 
        the four different reasons do begin to converge, but only slightly. There was a steep decline in moving for 'Other' 
        during the period between 2010 and 2014. One could extrapolate that this is likely at least mildly correlated with the aftermath of the Great 
        Recession of 2008, during which the housing market collapsed and many Americans struggled financially.
