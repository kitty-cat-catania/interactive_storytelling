4/ Population controls consistent with 2000 Census.,,,,,,,,,,
"5/ Caution should be used when comparing numbers/percents for distance moved between the 2002-2003 to 2004-2005 period with later periods. A change in processing resulted in a shift in the distribution of movers and distance moved for these years. For more information, see the Migration/Geographic Mobility User Notes and the the ""Impact of Processing on CPS Interstate Migration Rates"" note.",,,,,,,,,,

"Migration estimates from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) exclude persons less than one year old. The sample includes noninstitutionalized persons currently living in the United States (50 states and the District of Columbia) and living in a household with at least one civilian adult (at least 15 years old). Movers from Puerto Rico and the United States Island Areas are counted as movers from abroad.
