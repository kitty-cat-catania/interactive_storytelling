# interactive_storytelling

##Project 2 

For our second project, we will be visualizing data of intercountry migration patterns from 2000 to 2020 using an interactive dashboard page. Our data sources include https://netmigration.wisc.edu/, https://migrationdataportal.org, and https://www.census.gov/en.html. We are using the Census API and our new JS library is three.js. 

We have broken up the work as follows: 
-Pearl: SQL/SQLAlchemy
-Thomas: HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
-Ken: Flask app
-Gabrielle: API calls and visualizations
